this code is used to train an encoder-decoder neural network with an attention mechanism allowing the generation 
of paraphrases for both Arabic and English languages.
Thank you for using this code, before usage please make sure to read this file to properly execute it.

this code is used to train an encoder-decoder neural network with an attention mechanism allowing the generation 
of paraphrases.




1 - in order to run this code you must install all the libraries used in the code.

2 - you must use a GPU to speed up the training phase.

3 - please leave 20% of the dataset aside for testing.

4 - this code records a checkpoint after each epoch in order to keep track of the last point.

5 - this code uses the beam search decoding algorithm to generate multiple paraphrases.

6 - please use the code in 'Paraphrasing Evaluation Metric' to test your generated paraphrases.

7 - please respect the order of the code cells during execution.

For a proper functionality of the code, Please do not delete any of the files associated with the code.

For any malfunction of the code, please adress your problem to either of these adresses:
